## Screenshots and Analysis
The data I chose was from June 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. I wanted to discover what were the popular days and stations. Additionally, I wanted to find out more about the demographics of those who used citibikes during this time.


### Map

My map can be filtered by days of the week to indicate which stations are most popular during the day of your choosing. 


### Dashboards

#### Day and Station Popularity
In my dashboard named Day and Station Popularity, we can see that the most popular days are Saturdays and Sundays, followed by an increase in usage Thursdays and Fridays. The two most popular statioons are the Liberty Light Rail and Newport Parkway. On the map, the two stations are close to tourist destinations like the Statue of Liberty, meaning that the more people are around these stations, the more likely they are to rent a citibike.

#### Customer Breakdown

In my second dashboard named Customer Information, we can see that the user break down is almost a 50/50 split between one-time users and subscribers, with there being slightly more subscribers. The reason why there could be more subscribers is that an annual membership as of 2022 (unlimited 45-minute rides on a classic bike) is $17.99 a month, while a single ride is priced at $4.49/trip (one ride up to 30 minutes on a classic bike). If you are a consistent user, it would be a better deal to get the membership instead of using single rides. Additionally, I found that there are more male than female riders in the data that does contain the user's gender. Those that are unknown could most likely be single-use riders, and thus that data would not be collected. Another interesting phenomenon is that there is a huge peak in ridership among those born in 1969.
